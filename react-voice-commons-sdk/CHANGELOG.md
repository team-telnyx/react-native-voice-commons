# CHANGELOG.md

## [0.2.0](https://github.com/team-telnyx/react-native-voice-commons/releases/tag/commons-sdk-v0.2.0) (2026-04-01)

### Enhancement

- Upgraded low-level SDK dependency from `@telnyx/react-native-voice-sdk@0.4.0` to `@telnyx/react-native-voice-sdk@0.4.1`

### Bug Fixing

- Fixed push notification flags not being reset after call action execution, causing subsequent calls to be auto-answered

## [0.1.9](https://github.com/team-telnyx/react-native-voice-commons/releases/tag/0.1.9) (2026-03-19)

### Enhancement

- Upgraded low-level SDK dependency from `@telnyx/react-native-voice-sdk@0.3.0` to `@telnyx/react-native-voice-sdk@0.4.0`
- Commons SDK version now propagates to the low-level SDK User-Agent via `sdkVersion` option
- Added hidden long-press button on status text to disable push notifications for debugging
- Disabled debug logging and call reports by default for production readiness

### Bug Fixing

- Fixed stale push notification state by clearing pending VoIP push data on call end
- Fixed User-Agent inconsistency — all WebSocket messages now use `ReactNative-{version}` format
- Fixed unnecessary JSON-RPC ACK messages (invite, answer, ringing) that were causing issues
- Fixed `telnyxCallControlId` ReferenceError on inbound calls in the low-level SDK

## [0.1.8](https://github.com/team-telnyx/react-native-voice-commons/releases/tag/0.1.8) (2026-03-09)

### Bug Fixing

• Fixed duplicate CXProvider overwrite causing `CXEndCallAction` error 4 (unknownCallUUID) — guard `setupCallKit()` to prevent async `setupAutomatically()` from overwriting the provider created by `setupSynchronously()` during VoIP push handling
• Fixed intermittent audio loss on push notification calls — defer `CXAnswerCallAction.fulfill()` until `reportCallConnected()` when the WebRTC peer connection is ready
• Aligned iOS audio session handling with native Telnyx iOS SDK pattern (`RTCAudioSessionConfiguration.webRTC()` with `lockForConfiguration`/`unlockForConfiguration`)
• Fixed endCall not dismissing CallKit UI — check `endCall()` return value and fallback to `reportCallEnded()` when CXEndCallAction fails
• Fixed push notification answer crash when voipClient is not yet initialized — defer to `checkForInitialPushNotification()` instead of failing the call
• Added `voipClient.queueAnswerFromCallKit()` call when handling push notification answer for auto-answer on INVITE arrival
• Fixed call ENDED state not received by subscribers
• Added platform guards for iOS-only VoIP bridge methods on Android
• Fixed push data race condition in Expo apps

## [0.1.8-beta.1](https://github.com/team-telnyx/react-native-voice-commons/releases/tag/0.1.8-beta.1) (2026-03-04)

### Bug Fixing

• Fixed duplicate CXProvider overwrite causing `CXEndCallAction` error 4 (unknownCallUUID) — guard `setupCallKit()` to prevent async `setupAutomatically()` from overwriting the provider created by `setupSynchronously()` during VoIP push handling
• Fixed intermittent audio loss on push notification calls — defer `CXAnswerCallAction.fulfill()` until `reportCallConnected()` when the WebRTC peer connection is ready
• Aligned iOS audio session handling with native Telnyx iOS SDK pattern (`RTCAudioSessionConfiguration.webRTC()` with `lockForConfiguration`/`unlockForConfiguration`)
• Fixed endCall not dismissing CallKit UI — check `endCall()` return value and fallback to `reportCallEnded()` when CXEndCallAction fails
• Fixed push notification answer crash when voipClient is not yet initialized — defer to `checkForInitialPushNotification()` instead of failing the call
• Added `voipClient.queueAnswerFromCallKit()` call when handling push notification answer for auto-answer on INVITE arrival

## [0.1.8-beta.0](https://github.com/team-telnyx/react-native-voice-commons/releases/tag/0.1.8-beta.0) (2026-02-28)

### Bug Fixing

• Fixed push data race condition in Expo apps

## [0.1.7](https://github.com/team-telnyx/react-native-voice-commons/releases/tag/0.1.7) (2026-02-20)

### Enhancement

• Added `TelnyxVoipClient.isLaunchedFromPushNotification()` static method to check if the app was cold-started from a push notification, allowing consumers to skip auto-login and avoid double-login races
• `createTelnyxVoipClient()` now returns a singleton — safe to call inside React component bodies without creating a new instance on every render
• Added `destroyTelnyxVoipClient()` to tear down the singleton when a fresh instance is needed
• `TelnyxVoiceApp` now automatically wires the `voipClient` on the CallKit coordinator on mount — consumers no longer need to manually call `setVoipClient()` at the correct component level

### Bug Fixing

• Fixed cold-start push notification failures caused by double-login race between user auto-login and SDK internal push login
• Fixed CallKit coordinator having no `voipClient` reference when user answered a call via CallKit before navigating to the correct screen
• Fixed `call_id` extraction in `checkForInitialPushNotification` — the double-nested path `pushData.metadata?.metadata?.call_id` never resolved, so the CallKit coordinator was bypassed on iOS
• Refactored `checkForInitialPushNotification` into `getAndroidPushData` and `getIOSPushData` helpers to reduce nesting and improve readability

### Deprecation

• `setVoipClient()` on `CallKitCoordinator` and `useCallKitCoordinator()` hook is now deprecated — `TelnyxVoiceApp` handles this automatically

## [0.1.7-beta.0](https://github.com/team-telnyx/react-native-voice-commons/releases/tag/0.1.7-beta.0) (2026-02-18)

### Bug Fixing

• Fixed `call_id` extraction in `checkForInitialPushNotification` — the double-nested path `pushData.metadata?.metadata?.call_id` never resolved, so the CallKit coordinator was bypassed and all iOS push calls fell through to direct handling
• Refactored `checkForInitialPushNotification` into `getAndroidPushData` and `getIOSPushData` helpers to reduce nesting and improve readability

## [0.1.6](https://github.com/team-telnyx/react-native-voice-commons/releases/tag/0.1.6) (2025-12-09)

### Enhancement
